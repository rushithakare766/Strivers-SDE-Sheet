# Problem Name : [LongestConsecutiveSequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/LongestConsecutiveSequence)

## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

## Approach 
1. Create a set and store all the element in it.
2. traverse through the set and check If x-1 exists: This means x cannot be a starting number and we will move on to the next element in the set.
If x-1 does not exist: This means x is a starting number of a sequence. So, for number, x, we will start finding the consecutive elements.


## cpp solution
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        if(n==0){
            return 0;
        }
        int longest=1;
        unordered_set<int>st;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            st.insert(nums[i]);
        }

        for(auto it:st){
            if(st.find(it-1)==st.end()){
                int x=it;
                int cnt=1;
                while(st.find(x+1)!=s.end()){
                    x=x+1;
                    cnt=cnt+1;
                }
                longest=max(longest,cnt);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
};

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(3n) ,where space complexity is O(n)
