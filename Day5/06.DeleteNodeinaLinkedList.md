# Problem Name : [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/DeleteNodeinaLinkedList)

## Description
For the input, you should provide the entire linked list head and the node to be given node. node should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]


## cpp solution
```cpp
class solution{
    public:
        void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
            node->val=node->next->val;
            node->next=node->next->next;
    }
}

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(1) ,where space complexity is O(1).
