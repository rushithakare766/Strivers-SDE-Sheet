# Problem Name : [Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/Searcha2DMatrix)

## Description
You are given an m x n integer 'matrix' matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

## Approach
1. Place the 2 pointers i.e. low and high: Low start from 0 and high start from row*col-1;
2. Calculate the ‘mid’ using the formula mid=low+(high-low)/2;
3. Eliminate the halves based on the element at index mid. row = mid / M, col = mid % M

## cpp solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int row=matrix.size();
        int col=matrix[0].size();
        int start=0;
        int end=row*col-1;

        //find the middle element 
        int mid=start+(end-start)/2;

        while(start<=end){
            int ele=matrix[row/col][row%col];
            if(ele==target){
                return true;
            }
            if(ele<target){
                start=mid+1;
            }
            else{
                end=mid-1;
            }
            mid=start+(end-start)/2;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
