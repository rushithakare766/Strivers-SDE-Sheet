# Problem Name : [Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/Pow(x,n))

## Description
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

## Approach 
1. First intialize anns as 1.0 and make duplicate copy of n variable in nn 
2. if n is negative make it positive and run a loop till nn is greater than 0
3. if nn is odd then multiply by ans and decrement it by 1 otherwise multiply x by x and then divide it.


## cpp solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        double ans=1.0;
        long long nn=n;

        if(n<0)nn=-1*nn;

        while(nn){
            if(nn%2){
                ans=ans*x;
                nn=nn-1;
            }
            else{
                x=x*x;
                nn/=2;
            }
        }
        if(n<0) ans=(double)(1.0)/(double)(ans);
        return ans;
    }
};
## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(log(n),where space complexity is 0(1)
